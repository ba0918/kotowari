# Brainstorm

Interview the person until nothing is left implicit, then write the specification. This is
domain modeling: the goal is shared understanding, not a document. Compromise is not allowed,
and the station never ends itself — it ends when the tree is exhausted and the person approves.

## Inputs and outputs

In: what the person wants to talk about; when revising, the existing specification path.
Before the first round, list `.agents/tmp/brainstorm-*.md` and resume from a matching progress
file; otherwise name it for the specification you are heading toward, renaming when it settles.
Out: `docs/spec/<name>.md`, approved and committed, plus glossary updates. Progress lives in
`.agents/tmp/brainstorm-<name>.md` and is deleted after approval.

## The tree and its rounds

Every decision has prerequisites (decisions made before it) and, once made, branches into
smaller decisions. Work the tree in rounds: collect the questions whose prerequisites are all
settled; number them; attach a recommended answer to each (the person should not have to answer
from a blank page outside their expertise); present the round; recompute the tree from the
answers; repeat.

```
Q1: <question>

A. <recommended answer>
```

A question left unanswered is not decided: its recommendation is **not** adopted, it stays an
implicit assumption, and it is asked again next round. Finish only when every branch is
walked and no implicit assumption remains.

## Conduct

- Never propose a whole design and ask for approval; never fire yes/no questions to
  manufacture a "decided" state. Recommended answers on granular questions are different.
- Do not re-ask what was decided without a reason. Challenge the person's ideas and your own
  with counter-arguments and counter-examples; "no objection" is not agreement.
- Say which statements are verified facts, inferences from facts, and unverified hypotheses.
- Before proposing to replace something that exists, read it; never judge by name or summary.
- Delegate fact-finding to a separate-context agent and keep asking meanwhile.

### Terms and scenarios

When a word can be read two ways, ask "does *X* mean this?" with your reading as the
recommended answer, in the normal round. Settled definitions go into the glossary (the
repository's `CONTEXT.md`): what the term *is*, and the words not to use for it. Only words
read two ways whose meaning here is this project's — no general vocabulary in its general sense.

When deciding how concepts relate, present concrete scenarios — normal and edge cases — and ask
"what happens here?" so the person meets boundaries they had not considered. Only scenarios
whose prerequisites are settled go into a round. Counter-examples found this way become the
counter-examples attached to requirements.

When a requirement does not change observable product behavior (release automation, licensing,
CI), ask whether it belongs here, in a separate specification, or is not built. Never add it silently.

Whoever notices an ambiguous term or a boundary that disagrees with the code asks it there, records
what becomes clear, and hands it back here. Change the glossary and specification after the person
decides.

## Records

Six kinds, kept in the progress file and defined in `references/records.md`: agreement, prohibition,
undecided (with who decides), delegated (with reason), rejected (with reason), revision (what replaced
what). Never merge undecided with delegated. Overwrite only when meaning changes; resume from it.

## Writing the specification

Before writing, check for drafts, contradictions, vague words, missing scope boundaries,
related undecided items, and anything decided silently; any of these sends you back to the
dialogue. Specification silence never means "implementer decides".

Each heading-addressable requirement has an observable success condition and a counter-example.
Test its verification against **Evidence conditions**. On failure, express a non-code requirement
as human or platform inspection; drop a code behavior into an already reachable generic error path,
recording it as rejected with its missing conditions. Put agreements in the body, prohibitions in
what is not built, and rejected / undecided / delegated items in their own sections. Require
expensive model-running verification only when the person asks.

### Evidence conditions

An oracle — a test, a check, or a fixture — counts as evidence only when the condition it
produces has a named operational producer in a supported environment (untrusted input arriving
at a boundary is one), its subject is the product or a check rather than the oracle itself, the
rule it enforces is stated by the specification, and every wording, file layout, or internal
name it pins is declared there as a contract. An oracle that fails any of these is a cost: do
not add it, keep it in a change under review, or demand it.

A requirement whose only oracle would fail these conditions is not mechanically verifiable:
when it is not code, verify it by a human-run check or by the platform's own checker; when it
is code, drop the requirement and let the failure join a generic error path a reachable
failure already proves — never resolve it by having the implementer build the fixture.

## Finishing

1. Adversarial review, only when the specification's own requirements can contradict each other —
   several interdependent requirements, or one the record and the principles could pull apart.
   Say that reason, then launch one separate-context agent on the specification's own quality,
   and a second on conformance to the brainstorm record plus the repository's principles document
   when it keeps one (`docs/principles.md` by convention) — that second one only when the record
   is long enough that reading it back here would not catch the drift. A specification of a few
   standalone requirements gets none. New findings become branches; keep asking.
2. Check the conditions for handing to plan: one deliverable (one branch); result in one sentence;
   built and unbuilt scope; stored state and its lifetime decided or confirmed absent; external
   dependencies accepted or rejected; human decision points and what they see; headings to
   requirements.
3. Stage the specification and the glossary change, give the path, the diff command, and the
   judgment points — never the full text, and never a summary as the thing approved. The person
   commits or says to. Then delete the progress file.

description: "Workflow station of the ba0918 workflow: execute an approved plan step by step, test-first for code, committing one concern at a time, and hand back instead of guessing when a design decision is missing. Invoked by ba0918-cycle with a plan path, a branch, and a worktree path. Use when cycle delegates implementation of a ba0918 plan. 日本語キーワード: 実装 手順書を実行 TDD 実装計画"

# Implement

Carry out the plan you were given, in the order written. Code is built test-first; documents
and small scripts may be written directly. The person sees the result at the end of the cycle,
not per step.

## Inputs and outputs

In: the worktree path, the plan path, and the branch; work only inside that worktree. Out:
commits on that branch. A plan step names the
specification sections it rests on; read those sections and whatever else in the repository the
step needs. Nothing else is handed to you — the repository is the context.

## Stop only for these

Hand back (stop, state the reason, do not guess) when:

- a consequential design decision is not in the plan or the specification, or the approved
  content must change → back to brainstorm;
- the plan step asks for confirmation before an irreversible operation, a privileged operation,
  or a dangerous target (production data, configuration, external effects) → ask, then continue;
- continuing would spread damage (secret exposure, unintended publication, data loss) → stop;
- after diagnosing and changing approach once there is still no progress → stop;
- no test command can be determined (see below) → back to plan before writing product code.

Everything else you recover from yourself: an unplanned but safe file to add, a flaky helper
tool, a hook failure, an ordinary command failure, a missing bit of record you can reconstruct.
Never ask for acceptance of the result step by step; that happens once, at the end of the cycle.

## Completing a step

Each plan step says how its completion is shown. Four kinds; details in
`references/completion.md`:

- **Test**: RED → GREEN → REFACTOR, one small failing test per behavior, run in a shell at every
  transition.
- **Check**: run the check commands the plan lists, in order; done only when all succeed. Never
  substitute a different command on the spot.
- **Artifact**: a document such as a README or skill text; pass any format check that exists and
  leave it in a state an independent review can judge.
- **External**: real devices or measurements; hand back before running anything unsafe,
  privileged, or irreversible. Keep the command and a decision-relevant summary, not full logs.

The test command comes from, in order: the plan, the project's own instructions, the standard
tool for the ecosystem. If none decides it, hand back to plan.

## Committing

- One concern per commit. A test and the minimal code that makes it pass are one concern.
- Stage with `git add <path>`; never `git add .` or `-A`. Never disable or bypass hooks.
- Message: follow the repository's commit conventions; a body only when the *why* needs it.
  Never name a workflow station (brainstorm / plan / cycle / implement / review), a finding ID,
  or session chronology.
- Fixes outside the plan that do not change its thrust: commit them with the reason recorded,
  and list them in the final report. Anything that changes the thrust is a hand-back.
- Do not invent verification of verification: tests whose subject is a check or test helper itself,
  and tests pinning workflow prose, are created only when the plan, finding, or specification
  requires them. This does not bar unit tests of product helpers for behavior they support.
- For a deletion finding, no failing test is needed. Completion evidence is all existing checks
  passing after deletion.
- Keeping secrets out of commits is your responsibility; nothing scans for you.

## Resuming

There is no progress file. To resume, read the plan, `git log`, the working diff, and
`git status`, and infer where you are. Steps that leave no trace in git (check-only steps,
external checks) and approved-but-unexecuted human decisions are redone or re-asked.

## Report at the end

Commits made, verification evidence per step (test names run, check commands, artifact paths,
external summaries), out-of-plan changes with reasons, anything handed back and why.

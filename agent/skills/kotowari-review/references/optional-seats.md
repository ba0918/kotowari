# Optional seats

How the caller launches optional seats. Read it before a full review when the person's
user-scope instructions list optional seats; a reviewer is never given this file.

- **The list.** It sits in the person's user-scope instructions, the file their agent reads in
  every session. Each entry names the seat, its launch means (a command to run or a skill to
  call), and, optionally, a time limit.
- **How many.** The person's word for this run ("one seat this time", "all seats", "only gpt")
  or the caller's one-line reason overrides the count; otherwise run every seat on the list. The
  count includes the required quality reviewer: "one seat" means no optional seat. A word may
  name seats; a count without names takes optional seats in the order the list gives them.
- **Launching.** Seats may be launched in parallel. Hand each launch means the
  self-contained prompt the quality reviewer gets, rewritten for the seat's copy (below): the
  copy's path wherever the worktree's path appears, and every file the prompt references placed
  inside the copy or inlined. Run the launch means with the copy as its working
  directory, and read what it returns as the JSON in `SKILL.md`'s **Output**.
- **Throwaway copy.** Each seat runs inside its own copy of the worktree, created in a temporary
  directory outside it right before that seat is launched: the worktree's HEAD with its
  uncommitted changes and its untracked, non-ignored files laid over it (for example, a
  `git clone --shared` of the repository checked out detached at HEAD with its remote removed,
  `git diff HEAD --binary` applied in it when not empty, and the untracked files copied in).
  Leave out untracked symbolic links: a copied link still points where it did, and a seat
  writing through it reaches the person's worktree. The
  copy has its own repository, so a seat's stash, branches, and config stay in it. The caller
  that created the copy deletes it when the seat ends, whatever the outcome (its JSON read, or the
  seat absent for any reason); the copy is not one of the person's worktrees. Nothing a seat
  writes reaches the person's worktree.
- **Time limit.** Apply one only when the seat's entry writes it; otherwise wait for the launch
  means to finish.
- **Absent seats.** An optional seat that fails once is absent and is never retried. The reasons:
  quota exhausted, time limit reached, launch failed, and output unreadable as finding JSON. An
  absent optional seat does not stop the review or make it unsuccessful. A required seat that
  fails is handled as a failed review already is.
- **Merging and reporting.** The caller merges and dedupes optional seats' findings with the others
  as `SKILL.md`'s **Output** says; the finding shape does not change, and several seats raising the same thing
  adds no weight. The report states which optional seats attended and which were absent, each
  absence with its reason.
